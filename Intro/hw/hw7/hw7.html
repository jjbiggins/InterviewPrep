<b> Homework 7</b><BR> 

CS1210 Computer Science 1<BR> 
Due Monday, April 10, by 9:00am<br>
10 points
<br>
<br>

NOTE: Most of your time should be spend on question 3!<br><br>
  
<b>1.</b> (1 point) What is the Big-O running time bound (i.e. is it O(n), O(n log n), O(n*n), ...?) for function1 defined in
  <a href=function1.py>function1.py</a>?<br><br>
  
<b>2.</b> (2 points) What is the worst-case and best-case Big-O running time bounds for function2 defined in
  <a href=function2.py>function2.py</a>?<br><br>

<b>3.</b> (7 points) Carefully compare several sorting methods and produce a document discussing your results.  You will be graded on the quality
of your test data, the effectiveness of your charts/graphs, and your written discussion of the results.  <br><br>

Start with the code in <a href=hw7sorts.py>hw7sorts.py</a>.  The file includes three sorting methods: selection, insertion, merge, and builtin (Python's built-in sort).<br><br>

For this problem, you must add two additional sorting functions to the file and compare the running times of all of the sorting functions on a variety of data.<br><br>

One of the sorting functions you must add is quicksort. The other can be any other method you find (except bubble sort).  
You may search the Internet (or books) for Python implementations to use. (Note: Be careful with quicksorts found on the web - it's easy to find "bad" ones - see if you can use information from lecture 31 to find a good one).<br><br>

The write-up will likely be several pages.  It should (a) describe how you generated test data (2) include
graphs, charts, and/or tables of your timing results (these must be images of things generated by Python - no hand-made
graphs/charts/tables!), and
(c) discuss conclusions about the relative performance of the various sorts. This should include, where appropriate,
assessment of best/average/worst base behavior,  and of how performance data fits with what we know about 
the Big-O running time bounds of these methods.

<hr>
For this assignment, submit two things:
<ol>
<li>one Python file (containing everything in the original hw7sorts.py plus what you added, including code you used to generate your test data, timing results, and graphs/charts.)
<li> a pdf document containing written answers to Q1, Q2, and Q3.
NOTE: .doc,.rtf, and similar documents are <em>not acceptable</em>! Convert to pdf before submitting (via "Save As" or similar means)
</ol>
