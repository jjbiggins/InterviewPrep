NOTE: You may not use any functions from external modules loaded by 'import.' In addition, you may not use dictionaries, list comprehensions, or other Python language features not yet taught in this class. The point of these exercises is to practice very basic components of programming.<br><br> 
   
<p>
   <b>1.</b> Write a function, printStringStats(inputString), that takes as input a string of lowercase letters 
   and prints three things: the lexicographically largest letter (z > y > ... > a), the third largest letter, and the most common letter along with how many times it occurs. <br><br>
  You may assume the string is at least one character long. But you may not assume that it contains at least three different characters.  If fewer than three different letters appear in the string, print something appropriate for the third largest (e.g. "There is no third largest letter.")<br><br>
   If two or more letters tie for most common, you may choose any one of them.<br><br>
   For example:
   <pre>>>> printStringStats('aaczzcqzqqqzqc')
In 'aaczzcqzqqqzqc', the largest letter is 'z', the third largest letter is 'c',
 and the most common letter is 'q', occurring 5 times

>>> printStringStats("aaaaba")
In 'aaaaba', the largest letter is 'b', there is no third largest letter,
 and the most common letter is 'a', occurring 5 times
   </pre>
   NOTE: you may <em>not</em> use built-in min, max, sort, or sorted functions. You may not use any built-in string methods. Use one or more simple loops, and simple comparison (<,>, ==, !=) operators only.
     
<br><br>   
   <b>2.</b> Write a function primeDivisorsOf(num) that takes a positive integer as 
input and returns a list of that number's prime divisors. You may copy and use the numIsPrime function
developed in class if you wish. <br><br>

For example:
<pre>
>>> primeDivisorsOf(36)
[2,3]
>>> primeDivisors(23)
[23]
>>> 
>>> primeDivisorsOf(5003*5003+1)
[2, 5, 2503001]
>>> primeDivisorsOf(4)
[2]
>>> primeDivisorsOf(1)
[]
</pre>

<b>3.</b> Write function, innerMin(listOfLists), that 
takes as input a list of zero or more sublists each containing 
zero or more numbers, and determines and prints 1) minimum number among all of 
the sublists and 2) the sublist containing that minimum.
<br><br>
You may assume there is no tie for the minimum. I.e, <em>if</em> there is a minimum, 
it is unique. 
If, however, there is no minimum, innerMin should print an appropriate message.

<br><br>
For example:
<pre>>>>innerMin([[6, 7], [9, 4, 6]])
In [[6, 7], [9, 4, 6]] the min item is 4 and is found in sublist [9, 4, 6]
</pre>
You should use nested loops for this problem, an outer loop iterating over items (sublists) of the main list, and an inner loop stepping over items (numbers) in the sublists.   In the inner loop, only simple comparisons should be used. Once again, you may not use built-in 
functions min,  max, sort or sorted for this problem.
  
<br><br>
<b>4.</b> Write functions testQ1(), testQ2(), and testQ3() that test your Q1, Q2, and Q3 functions
on a variety of input values.

For example, for some imagined function foo(n1, n2), a test function and its output might
be:
<pre>
def testFoo():
    print("foo(2,3) returns {}".format(foo(2,3)))
    print("foo(5, -1) returns {}".format(foo(5, -1)))
    print("foo(100, -23) returns {}".format(foo(100, -23)))

>>> testFoo()
foo(2,3) returns 2
foo(5, -1) returns 6
foo(100, -23) returns -24
</pre>
Note: most good test functions should contain more than three tests!

<hr>
Submit to ICON one python file containing all the required functions.
The file must not contain any code that is not part of a function definition.
