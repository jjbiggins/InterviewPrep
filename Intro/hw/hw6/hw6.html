  <b>1.</b> Create a Box class, representing rectangular 3D boxes.  The boxes can be any size and
  can be located anywhere in 3D space, but in this simple version their orientations are fixed so that their edges are always aligned with/parallel to coordinate system axes.  You class must implement all the methods below:
  
<ul>
<li> __init__(self, centerX = 0.0, centerY = 0.0, centerZ = 0.0, width = 1.0, height = 1.0, depth = 1.0)
<li> setCenter(self, x, y, z)
<li> setWidth(self, width)
<li> setHeight(self, height)
<li> setDepth(self, depth)
<li> volume(self)
<li> surfaceArea(self) 
<li> overlaps(self, otherBox)
<li> contains(self, otherBox)
<li> __repr__(self)
</ul>
Note that "width" is a box's extent along the x dimension, while "height" and "depth" are the y and z extents, respectively.<br>
box1.overlaps(box2) should return True if the two 3D boxes touch/intersect at all (even they just touch exactly at their edges or corners).<br>
box1.contains(box2) should return True if no point of box2 is outside of box1<br>

<em>Note: think carefully about the overlaps and contains test. It is easy to get these wrong.
  I recommend (before you start coding) sketching some pictures to help you analyze the possibilities.</em>
<br><br>
Use of the class in a Python shell might look like this:
<pre>
   >>> box1 = Box(10.0, 5.0, 0.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0)
   >>> box1
   < 2-by-1-by-1 3D box with center at (10.0, 5.0, 0.0) >
   >>> box2 = Box(0, 0, 0, 3.5, 2.5, 1.0)
   >>> box1.volume()
   2.0
   >>> box2.surfaceArea()
   29.5
   >>> box1.overlaps(box2)
   False
   >>> box1.setCenter(2.75, 0.0, 0.0)
   >>> box1.overlaps(box2)
   True
   >>> box1.setCenter(2.76, 0.0, 0.0)
   >>> box1.overlaps(box2)
   False
   >>> box1.setCenter(2.75, 1.75, 1.0)
   >>> box1.overlaps(box2)
   True
   >>> box1.setCenter(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
   >>> box1.overlaps(box2)
   True
   >>> box1.setWidth(50.0)
   >>> box1.overlaps(box2)
   True
   >>> box1.setDepth(50.0)
   >>> box2.overlaps(box1)
   True
   >>> box3 = Box(0, 0, 0)
   >>> box2.contains(box3)
   True
   >>> box4 = Box(10.0, 5.0, 0.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0)
   >>> box4.contains(box3)
   False 
</pre>
</ul>
As part of your .py file for this problem, include a testBox function that demonstrates
use of the Box class, printing helpful output.<br><br>


<b>2.</b> Create a NimGame class that implements the simplest form of two-player Nim-style games
(<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim</a>), sometimes called the "subtraction game."  The game starts with some specific
number of items - pebbles, coins, matchsticks, balls. Players take turns removing between 1 and 3 items. 
The player who removes the last item wins.  You can play an interactive on-line version of the game here:
<a href=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Subtraction_game_SMIL.svg>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Subtraction_game_SMIL.svg</a>
<br><br>
For this assignment, we'll keep things very simple. Assume there's one human player playing against the computer
and that the human always goes first.
<br>
   To create the NimGame class, you only need to implement two methods:
<ol>
   <li> an __init__ method, with an argument specifying how many items (call them "balls") the game should start with
 <li> a remove method, with an argument specifying how many balls the human player wishes to remove.  This method should check that the specified number of balls is valid and, if so, remove that many balls, and check whether or not the player has lost.  Next, it should automatically select a (legal) number of balls for the computer to remove (either randomly or through a "smart" strategy), and it should update the game state accordingly (and check whether the computer has lost).  
</ol>
A sample use of the class might produce these results:
<pre>
   >>> game = NimGame(12)
   Nim game initialized with 12 balls.
   >>> game.remove(2)
   You took 2 balls. 10 remain.
   Computer took 3 balls. 7 remain.
   >>> game.remove(1)
   You took 1 ball. 6 remain.
   Computer took 2 balls. 4 remain.
   >>> game.remove(1)
   You took 1 ball. 3 remain.
   Computer took 3 balls. 0 remain.
   Computer wins!
</pre>

 <b>3.</b> 
Add one additional subclass of Animal, including at least one new method, to
the code in <a href="animals.py">animals.py</a>.
As part of your new .py file (which will contain the original code from animals.py plus your new class), include a testAnimals() function that demonstrates use of your new class.
<br><br>
<hr>
Submit via ICON exactly three Python files (or one .zip file containing three .py files),
one for each question. The files must not contain any top-level 
   code that is not an import statement or part of a function or class definition.
