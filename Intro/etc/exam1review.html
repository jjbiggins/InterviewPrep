Review notes for CS1210 Exam 1, Spring 2017

  Exam date: Thursday, Feb. 23, 6:30-8:00, MacBride Auditorium

Exam is closed-book: no notes, no computers, no phones, no Internet.
 
Types of questions:

1) Trace/hand-execute code to determine what it does in specific 
   circumstances. (this includes both what the code might *print* and 
   what it might *return* - these are two different notions that a
   good number of people still sometimes misunderstand)
 
2) Write code (typically in the form of a function/def) to match a 
   given English specification.  A question of this form might be:
   "Write a program that returns the minimum value from among three
   input numbers."  

3) Assess/analyze what a program/code does and give a concise English 
   description. E.g. an answer might be 
   "program1 determines and returns the minimum of the three given input 
   numbers" is an appropriate answer.  

   Note that such answers should try to be precise but concise overall 
   descriptions of what a program does.  If your descriptions looks like 
   "it takes the first number and compares it to the second, and then loops 
   for a while, decrementing a counter and changing a variable, before 
   finally ..., and then t returns a number" you're probably not on the 
   right track.  I'm not looking for a description of the *process* the 
   program goes through to get to an answer.  Instead, I want a description 
   of what it computes, in terms of the given input.

-----------------

MATERIAL COVERED (Chapters/Sections refer to "Think Python" textbook):

MAIN THINGS THAT WILL BE TESTED:
Exam1 will test ability to understand, evaluate, and write Python
programs using expressions, variables, assignments, conditional statements,
loops, and functions (involving values of type integer, float, Boolean, string,
and list).

CHAPTER 1 and 2 (all sections):

basic expressions/operations (1.4, 2.3, 2.6))
basic types (1.5)
variables and assignments (2.1, 2.2)

CHAPTER 3 (all sections):

functions, function calls, parameters and arguments (3.1-3.7)
variables and parameters are local to functions! (3.8)
stack diagrams (3.9)
functions that return values vs. those that don't (but might print something) (3.10)  

CHAPTER 5 (all sections):

integer division, modulus (5.1)
boolean/logical expressions (5.2, 5.3)
conditional expressions - if/elif/else (5.4-5.7)
recursion (5.8-5.10)

CHAPTER 6 (all sections):

Chapter 6 provides does not introduce any new Python language constructs
nor concrete programming concepts. Instead, it provides helpful 
suggestions/advice on writing functions and
programs, and it is definitely worth reading carefully.

CHAPTER 7 (all sections):

reassignment and updating variables (7.1, 7.2)
basic iteration - while (7.3)
print vs. return (know the difference!)

CHAPTER 8 (all sections):

strings as sequences (8.1)
traversing strings using for (8.3, 8.6, 8.7)
string slices (8.4)
strings are immutable (8.5)
string methods, in operator, string comparison (8.8, 8.9, 8.10)

CHAPTER 9 (all sections):

This chapter introduced a few operations useful for reading 
files - open, strip, etc.  These are not required for the exam.
The problems discussed in the chapter are good basic exercises.

CHAPTER 10 (all sections):

lists as seqences (10.1)
lists are mutable (10.2)
traversing lists using for (10.3)
range (10.3)
list operations, slices, and methods, del (10.4-10.6, 10.8)
lists and strings, split, join (10.9)
mutability, identity, aliasing (10.10, 10.11)
